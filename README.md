# Same-Day Scheduler App  
This is my app for keeping track of upcoming events for the current workday. Current functionality includes:  
-Use of luxon.js api for handling date and times.  
-Hour long time blocks for the standard workday (9am - 5pm).  
-Locally based contextual formatting based on the current time.  
-Events saved locally on the user's browser so that the page can be refreshed while maintain the current day's set events.
